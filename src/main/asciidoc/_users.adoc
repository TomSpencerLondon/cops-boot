== User Management

=== User information

The API allows to get information on the currently logged on user
via a `GET` on `/api/users/me`. If you are not a logged on user, the
following response will be returned:

operation::own-user-details-when-not-logged-in-example[snippets='http-request,http-response']
//end::initial-doc[]

If you do log on as a user, you get more information on that user:

operation::authenticated-officer-details-example[snippets='http-request,http-response,response-fields']
